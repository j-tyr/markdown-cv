# James Tyrrell
Software Engineer | PhD Applied Mathematics | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-tyrrell/)

## Career objectives

To further develop experience producing commercial software, drawing on mathematical expertise.  
Continue ongoing promotion of Sustainability initiatives and research within the Digital space.  

## Software development experience

Working with __C++__ in current role (and in former Research Fellow role) as well as the __Qt__ toolkit.  
Extensive use of __MATLAB__ during PhD.  
Familiarity with __Javascript__, __Julia__, and __Python__ through intermittent project work and personal use.  

## Current role

`Nov 2019 - Present`  
__Software Developer at Arup__  
Primary developer for Oasys REPORTER, a tool for automatically generating reports from finite element analysis results.  
Engaged in full-stack development using C++ and the Qt toolkit.  

__Major responsibilites__  
Developing new enhancements,  
Fixing existing bugs,  
Designing QA tests,  
Integrating third-party libraries into our software and keeping them up to date,  
Handling support requests from clients,  
Liaising with the Product Manager to discuss the future vision for our software.  

__Additional responsibilites__  
Engaged in Green / Sustainable Software research on behalf of the Oasys LS-DYNA group.  
Former Sustainability co-lead for the Advanced Digital Engineering group.  

## Education - University of Birmingham

`Feb 2019 - Nov 2019`  
__Postdoctoral Research Fellow__  
Working in the Chemical Engineering department.  
Modelling twin screw granulation - an emerging technology for the improved processing of pharmaceutical ingredients prior to tabletting.  

`Sep 2015 -Feb 2019`  
__PhD in Applied Mathematics__  
Working in the Mathematical Biology group.  
Thesis title: `Modelling cytosolic flow and vesicle transport in the growing pollen tube'.  

`Sep 2011 - Jul 2015`  
__MSci Mathematics__  
Graduated with first class honours.

## Project work

__Oasys Suite__ (three major releases)  
Primarily focused on bug fixing, QA testing, and updating documentation for __Oasys 17.0__, having joined the team in the latter half of the software release cycle.   
Added the ability to capture MP4 content from D3PLOT for later playback in REPORTER in __Oasys 18.0__, involving a significant update to our use of third-party FFmpeg libraries in our software.   
Updated REPORTER for an improved viewing experience on high-DPI displays in __Oasys 19.0__, alongside a renewed focus on back-end improvements (e.g. updating Qt libraries, built from source, across our Windows and Unix systems).  

__Computational mathematics__  
Researched the application of Fast Multipole Boundary Element Methods to granular flow, comparing results to those achievable using other similar methods (e.g. Discrete Element Methods).  
Derived coupled partial differential equations for chemical concentrations in the growing pollen tube (essential for plant fertilisation), solved numerically in MATLAB.  
Developed a novel numerical solution method (based on Regularised Stokeslets) for certain axisymmetrical fluid-flow problems, with an improved speed and accuracy over other conventional methods.  
Iterated and improved upon a set of equations for measuring the immune response of zebrafish to fungal infection.  

## Conferences and collaborative work  

__Conference presentations__  
British Young Mathematicians Colloquium (Birmingham Summer 2016).  
9th International Plant Biomechanics Conference (Montreal August 2018).  
UK Fluids Conference (Manchester September 2018).  

__Study Groups__  
Participated in the 2016 and 2017 Multi-Scale Biology Study Group at the University of Birmingham, working on multiple group projects.  
Organised the final presentation for one of these projects and made significant contributions to final written report (2016).   
Developed MATLAB code to find a partial solution to a given problem and took a leading role in presenting this work (2017).  

Also collaborated with experimental biologists throughout my PhD, breaking down complex mathematics into a common scientific language.  

## Awards  

_Editors' Suggestion_ for my article in Physical Review Fluids, awarded to fewer than 10% of papers submitted to the journal.  
Andrew King Prize for "outstanding performance in the field of Applied Mathematics" (MSci gradutation).  
Allied Maples Prize for "meritorious and promising work in the field of industrially or commercially applicable mathematics" (MSci thesis).  
BP Excellence Scholarship as an undergraduate, worth Â£5000 a year for the duration of my undergraduate studies.
